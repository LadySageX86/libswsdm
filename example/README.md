*libswsdm* is a very simple specification designed primarily for saving and loading game data. The project uses only standard C++ and is therefore highly portable. 

This example is meant as a demonstration of how *libswsdm* can be used in your project. Building this example requires Raylib, which can be found at https://github.com/raysan5/raylib.git. The example also expects that the required headers and libraries are in your system's include and lib paths, respectively.

## Instructions

Use the arrow keys to move the magenta square. Use SHIFT+F(1-3) to save the current position of the square to the respective file and use F(1-3) to reload the previous position from the respective file.
